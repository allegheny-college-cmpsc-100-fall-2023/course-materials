# Evaluation

This course uses specifications grading in order to facilitate grading transparency and allow students many chances to demonstrate proficiency over the concepts in the course. This method of grading might take some getting used to, but research has indivated it can improve learning outcomes while also reducing stress [RESEARCH]. 

Rather than getting individual grades for each assignment, you receive a pass or a fail grade on a series of fifteen evaluation criteria that add up to twenty points. The following point values will correspond to the following grades: 

| | | | | | | |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|20|<b>A</b>|19|<b>A-</b>| | | Excellent
|18|<b>B+</b>|17|<b>B</b>| 16 | <b>B-</b>| LANGUAGE
|15|<b>C+</b>|14|<b>C</b>| 13 | <b>C-</b>| Satiscatory
|12|<b>D+</b>|11|<b>D</b>|  | | LANGUAGE
|<=10 | F| | | | | Fail

There are two categories of evaluation criteria: Python Fundamentals, as well as Partipation & Expression.

## Participation & Expression

There are five categories for Participation & Expression that will be evaluated. These categories are worth up to two points each, depending on how many you pass. If you pass all five categories, you will receive ten points for participation and expression. 

If you fail even one P&E cateogry, the highest grade you can receive in the course is a C (which corresponds to 14 points). If you pass four or fewer P&E categories, each will add two points to your score up to but not exceeding fourteen points.

## Python Fundamentals 

There are ten Python fundamentals (or primitivies) that will be evaluated. In order to receive a checkmark for a Python primitive, you must use it in a certain number of labs and timed assessments, as specified below. While you can use other peoples' code in your assignments, the code used toward these evaluations should be original. It should also be documented using code comments. 

| Category | Lab | Timed | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| variables | 5 | 3 |
| lists | 3 | 2 |
| while loops | 3 | 2 |
| for loops | 2 | 2 |
| math & logic | 2 | 2 |
| functions | 2 | 2 |
| return | 2 | 1 |
| dictionaries | 1 | 1 |
| classes | 1 | 1 |
| methods | 1 | 1 |

As we go over these concepts, I will provide resources to give clarity on how you can incorporate them in your code. Everyone will receive ONE free point toward Python Fundamentals.
