# Study Guide for Timed Assessment on November 10

On Friday, 11/10, we will have our thrid timed assessment. I will post the test link at 10 AM 11/10 and you will have until 8 PM the Monday 11/13 to complete it. **You may complete the exam anywhere, but you may not assist or receive assistance from other people, whether or not they are a student in thie class.**
The professor will not be available to answer questions about the test after 10:50 AM on 11/10, so it's strongly recommended you start the test during classtime.

After 8 PM 11/13, it will no longer be possible to submit the test. Late submissions might not receive credit. 

The test will include opportunities to get credit for **variables**, **math and logic**, **while-loops**, **for-loops**, **lists**, **if-else**, **functions**, **return**, and **dictionaries**. 

You can take the test wherever you want. It is up to you whether you'd like to come to the classroom to take the test, but you should take it somewhere with a reliable internet connection. Take advantage of the school's wired connection resources [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XT_xfnbDbVM-xumOqwRObLd1DhJUgyh2HeOG-CXzyjo/edit#heading=h.kk1966kbedef). 

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> If you'd like some support studying for your exam, you can [book an office hours appointment](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/appointments/schedules/AcZssZ1ZnFy9IkWemSjQ98WWhGh7UVwkph3U2RuDrrLt781dWM4x_bQPunp9mylOe8TXdHWjtKpGa1SP). You can also seek support from [technical leaders](https://www.cs.allegheny.edu/teaching/technicalleaders/). 

### To study for the test, start by making sure you understand the "animate your words" group lab and the most recent timed assessment ("cube of pyramids"). 

The most important concepts covered on the test can be found in these two assignments. 
The solution to the last timed assessment is available below, for your review:

You can find your group's "Animate Your Words" lab [here](https://classroom.github.com/a/hnKK5hYi). 


### Another great resource for study is the [lecture content](https://github.com/allegheny-college-cmpsc-100-fall-2023/course-materials/blob/main/lecture-content/lecture-links.md) from our classes so far. 

Find the lecture content [here](https://github.com/allegheny-college-cmpsc-100-fall-2023/course-materials/blob/main/lecture-content/lecture-links.md).

### More on how the test works

The test will be in Github in the same format as most of our assignments, with the difference that you will not be able to update your code after the testing period is over, and you will not be able to see Gatorgrade checks. Github will pull your code wherever it is at the time of your last submission during the testing period. 

The test will be "open-book," meaning that you can look things up online while you are working on the test. HOWEVER, I have designed the test such that there are no solutions readily available on Google. While you may be able to look up the different concepts on the test, I will be asking you to apply them in a unique way. Because the assessment has a limited window, it's in your best interest to study ahead of time. 

The test will also be open enough that it is highly improbable that two students would write the same code, or even code that is very similar. 

<strong>In order to get credit for the code on the test, you must document it appropriately with code comments.</strong> Write a comment explaining what every line of code is doing. See code demos as well as [this chapter from <em>Think Python</em>](https://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/thinkpython2003.html#sec22) for examples of Code Comments.

This test will include opportunities to get credit for **variables**, **math and logic**, **while-loops**, **for-loops**, **lists** and **if-else**.  You will have additional chances to get these checkmarks on future tests, so don't worry if you don't get through all of them this time. However, if you didn't receive checkmarks on the last test, it is a good idea to put some effort into studying for this one.
