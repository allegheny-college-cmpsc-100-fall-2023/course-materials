# Study Guide for Timed Assessment on November 10

## Test Information 
- The test will be available on Friday, November 10 at 10:00 AM. You will have until Monday, November 13 at 8:00 PM to complete it.
- It's a good idea to start the test during class on Friday. I will not be available to answer questions on the test after that. 
- You CANNOT turn in your test after 8pm on Monday, November 13. It is a good idea to add your Trinket right away so that whatever results you have are scraped at the end of the testing period.
- You CANNOT get help from ANYONE else on the test. If you do, it's likely I'll be able to tell (I have been looking at code daily for around a decade and it's easy for me to spot stuff), and there will be consequences — including possible loss of credit and honor code violation.
- This test is meant to evaluate your proress toward the **Scienctific Process** course objective: Apply Python programming principles to execute and explain computer code that implements interactive, novel solutions to a variety of computable problems
- You will still have more chances to fulfill many of the desired outcomes in this course even if you do poorly on the first three tests. By the same token, if you do well enough on the first four tests, you may have the option to skip the fifth test without consequences.

### Another great resource for study is the [lecture content](https://github.com/allegheny-college-cmpsc-100-fall-2023/course-materials/blob/main/lecture-content/lecture-links.md) from all of our classes so far. 

Find the lecture content [here](https://github.com/allegheny-college-cmpsc-100-fall-2023/course-materials/blob/main/lecture-content/lecture-links.md).

### More on how the test works

The test will be in Github in the same format as most of our assignments, with the difference that you will not be able to update your code after the testing period is over, and you will not be able to see Gatorgrade checks. Github will pull your code wherever it is at the time of your last submission during the testing period. 

The test will be "open-book," meaning that you can look things up online while you are working on the test. HOWEVER, I have designed the test such that there are no solutions readily available on Google. While you may be able to look up the different concepts on the test, I will be asking you to apply them in a unique way. Because the assessment has a limited window, it's in your best interest to study ahead of time. 

The test will also be open enough that it is highly improbable that two students would write the same code, or even code that is very similar. 

<strong>In order to get credit for the code on the test, you must document it appropriately with code comments.</strong> Write a comment explaining what every line of code is doing. See code demos as well as [this chapter from <em>Think Python</em>](https://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/thinkpython2003.html#sec22) for examples of Code Comments.

This test will include opportunities to get credit for **variables**, **math and logic**, **while-loops**, **for-loops**, **lists** and **if-else**.  You will have additional chances to get these checkmarks on future tests, so don't worry if you don't get through all of them this time. However, if you didn't receive checkmarks on the last test, it is a good idea to put some effort into studying for this one.
