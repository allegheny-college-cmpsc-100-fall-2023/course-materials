# Thank you for filling out the course feedback survey!

## Your feedback means a lot, and I am responding with the following actions

- I will work on slowing down and explaining code one line at a time, rather than in chunks.
- I will add more open-ended coding exercises where you can be creative and draw what you want on the VPython canvas. 
- If a concept is confusing in the way I have explained it, you can anonymously request I approach it again a different way using a request form linked in the syllabus
- I will keep a running glossary of course terms linked in the syllabus (so far it includes terms from the last couple weeks, and I will continue adding to it)
- While I cannot switch to using Canvas at this point in the semester, I will try to add some of Canvas's functionality to Github. (Feel free to request specific functions in the request form above)
