# Thank you to those of you who filled out the course feedback survey

## Your feedback means a lot, and I am responding with the following actions

- I will work on slowing down and explain code one line at a time, rather than in chunks.
- I will add more open-ended coding exercises where you can be creative and draw what you want on the VPython canvas. 
- If a concept is confusing to you or I have explained it too quickly, you can anonymously request I approach it again a different way using this request form. 
- I will keep a running glossary of course terms in Github (so far it includes terms from the last couple weeks)
- While I cannot switch to using Canvas at this point in the semester, I will try to add some of Canvas's functionality to Github. (Freel free to request specific functions in the request form above)
