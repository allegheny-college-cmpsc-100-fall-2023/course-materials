## Variables and Perception

A variable is a symbol/placeholder for a value that may change.

Computer variables and natural language might not be as different as youâ€™d think.

Different words and symbols can have different meanings for different people. They may even change over time for an individual. In the same way, the value inside a variable can change.

## Color Tools

- [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/)
- [Munsell Color System](https://pteromys.melonisland.net/munsell/)
- To convert RGB 256 colors to VPython vector colors
```
#colors encoded in 256 color RBG format
#(a format very commonly found onlin3)
r256 = 	0
g256 = 163
b256 = 108

#convert from 256 color scheme to 0-1
r1 = r256/255
g1 = g256/255
b1 = b256/255

t = pyramid() #draw pyramid
#color pyramid using converted colors
t.color = vector(r1, g1, b1) 

```
This example colors a pyramid a jade hue. [See the example on trinket.](https://trinket.io/library/trinkets/44eaa525a0)
