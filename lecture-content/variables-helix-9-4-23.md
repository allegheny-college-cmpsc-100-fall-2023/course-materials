## Variables, a quick introduction

Variables are containers: they can hold a variety of different values. You could imagine a variable as a tea bag, and its value as the kind of tea the bag holds. While the procedure might be the same for different kinds of tea, the flavor will vary depending on the contents of the bag. Wherever a variable appears in code, it deploys the value it contains, much as a teabag releases its flavors when placed in hot water. Variables allow programs to respond to varying stimuli differently, and this is powerful.

In Python variables are assigned by first naming the variable, then putting an equals sign, then assigning the variable a value. 
  
```
  pet_type = "cat"
  pet_name = "Fifi"
  print( "My "  + pet_type "'s name is " + pet_name)
  #outputs "My cat's name is Fifi" 

  pet_type = "dog"
  pet_name = "Fido"
  print( "My "  + pet_type "'s name is " + pet_name)
  #outputs "My dog's name is Fido"
  
```
