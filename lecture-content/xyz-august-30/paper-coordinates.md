# Paper Coordinates Exercises

## 2D Exercise

1. Write your name at the top of the paper. 
2. Draw a simple drawing (made up of eight coordinates or fewer) on the top coordinate plane on your 2D paper. Identify the coordinates and write them down on a <b>separate piece of paper</b>. 
3. Fold your paper in half so that one side has a blank grid and one side has your drawing. 
4. Pass your paper, blank side up, to the person to your right. Receive a folded paper from the person to your left. 
5. Write down your coordinates from step 1 on top of the blank grid you have just received, and pass it back to the person who gave it to you.
6. Recreate the person to you right's drawing by replicating their coordinates. 

## 3D Exercise
### Note that 3D rendering is much more challenging than 2D. This is partly because 3D graphics can be seen from infinite possible <em>perspectives</em>, but in our static renderings we have to choose just one. I will give you credit for this assignment as long as I see a sincere effort. 
1. Follow the professors' example of drawing a box and then translating it.
2. Chooose another (X, Y, Z) vector (any three numbers you want as long as they'll stay on the page) and write it on your paper. Translate the box a second time by this vector. 
3. On the other side of your page, jam out! Draw whatever you want, but try to use the grid to provide some guidance. Here are some images for inspiration:
