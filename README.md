## Course Description

### Catalog Description

An introduction to the principles of computer science with an emphasis on creative expression through the medium of a programming language. Participating in hands-on activities that often require teamwork, students learn the computational structures needed to solve problems and produce computational artifacts which address these problems in real-world contexts. Students also learn how to organize and document a program's source code so that it effectively communicates with the intended users and maintainers. Additionally, the introduction includes an overview of the discipline of computer science and computational thinking. During a weekly laboratory session students use industry-grade technology to complete projects, reporting on their results through both written documents and oral presentations. Students are invited to use their own departmentally approved laptop in this course; a limited number of laptops are available for use during class and lab sessions. Prerequisite: None. Distribution Requirements: ME, SP.

### Additional Description

This section of CMPSC-100 uses the VPython library to facilitate a creative and visual approach to learning Python. VPython is a lightweight 3D module that allows students to create three-dimensional image renderings with just a few lines of code. Because this class approaches coding from a creative angle, it emphasizes not just the how of coding but the why behind creating one project versus another. The class includes weekly discussions of assigned materials. These materials might include artworks made using code, articles about the tech industry within a larger social context, and other media that illuminate how decisions made by coders can influence the world around us. 

This class focuses on applications right away, operating on the premise that the ability to write functional code as soon as possible will facilitate future abstract and theoretical understanding. In other words, we approach coding as something best learned by doing. The way computer science is presented often includes a sort of genius mystique that excludes a lot of people. In reality, no one knows everything there is to know about computer science. In addition, programming languages are created by humans with human flaws.

Frustration is part of it. Inside confusion lie the seeds of understanding. The sensation where your brain hurts is a sign that your brain is working, just like a muscle. This class presents computer science as something that is indisputably powerful and useful, but no more rarefied than any other discipline. To write excellent code is a fantastic goal, but ultimately the thing that matters most is what that code does in the world. 

### Learning Outcomes

Students who earn a C or better in this course will achieve the following objectives: 

#### Scientific Process (SP)
- Apply foundational Python language concepts to writing programs that generate visual and text outputs
- Use VSCode, git, and GitHub to develop, version, and release code consistent with industry-standard practices


#### Modes of Expression (ME)
- Conceptualize and execute original interactive, animated, and three-dimensionally rendered screen-based projects using Python
- Begin developing a personal sense of investment in computer programming projects through written ideation and reflection i.e. begin to form clear objectives for writing code within a greater context, and reflect on how your code achieves those objectives

## Required materials

### Laptop

A department-approved laptop, with an adequate charge, is required in every class session.

The laptop requirements are avaialable [here](https://www.cs.allegheny.edu/resources/laptops/#:~:text=Department%20Approved%20Laptops&text=In%20order%20to%20successfully%20complete,10%20or%2011%2064%2Dbit). If you don't have a laptop that meets these specifications, you can request to borrow one using [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSds-N61LLpYpZZBunlR_JigGH9eOBxvZfpEV71o73DyhTDQvw/viewform). The department has a limited number of loaner laptops available, so the earlier you request, the better! 



### Textbook(s)

There are no textbooks for this course. Any texts or articles used will be available online or distributed in class. 

### Platforms

This course relies on the GitHub, Discord, and Trinket. Your work will be assigned and evaluated using these platforms and official course communication will take place through them. You are expected to sign up for accounts and remain active on these platforms throughout the semester.

## Evaluation

### Evaluation criteria are subject to change, but those changes should always favor the student. 

This course uses specifications grading to facilitate grading transparency and allow students many chances to demonstrate proficiency in the concepts in the course. This method of grading might take some getting used to, but research has indicated it can improve learning outcomes while also reducing stress. 

Rather than getting individual grades for each assignment, you receive a pass or a fail grade on a series of fifteen evaluation criteria that add up to twenty points. The following point values will correspond to the following grades: 

| | | | | | | 
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|20|<b>A</b>|19|<b>A-</b>| | 
|18|<b>B+</b>|17|<b>B</b>| 16 | <b>B-</b>| 
|15|<b>C+</b>|14|<b>C</b>| 13 | <b>C-</b>| 
|12|<b>D+</b>|11|<b>D</b>|  | | 
|<=10 | F| | | | | 

Note that a C grade is considered satisfactory and will allow advancement into higher-level Computer & Information Science Courses. There are two categories of evaluation criteria: Python Fundamentals, as well as Partipation & Expression.

## Participation & Expression

I will evaluate you on five criteria for Participation & Expression. These categories are worth up to two points each, depending on how many you pass. If you pass all five categories, you will receive ten points for participation and expression. 

If you fail even one P&E category, the highest grade you can receive in the course is a C (which corresponds to 14 points). If you pass four or fewer P&E categories, each will add two points to your score up to but not exceeding fourteen total points. 

### Attendance & Participation

To receive a checkmark for attendance and participation, you will have to complete each of the following:  

- Attend at least 80% of lecture sessions
- Attend at least 80% of lab sessions
- Speak in 10 or more class sessions (this can include sharing work, asking questions, answering questions, and participating in discussions). I might call on you or ask what you think during a class session, and this will count. 
- Share at least one lab assignment and one coding exercise with the class. Your exercise shares will be casual. Lab shares will be a bit more polished. You can choose which lab you share, but we may have limited slots for each lab. 

### Teamwork

Teamwork is evaluated both on your contributions to group labs and your readiness to allow others to participate and learn. If another student in your group is struggling with a concept, see if you can help them understand it, rather than doing it for them. 

Your teamwork grade will be based on instructor observations of your participation in group work, as well as your code contributions and reflections on group assignments. To receive a checkmark for teamwork, you should:

- Participate actively in group labs. 
- Complete reflection requirements for 80% of group labs. 
- Contribute commits to group lab repositories, once we have set up collaborative repos later in the semester. 

### In-class Exercises

We will have an in-class exercise during almost every lecture session. To receive a checkmark for in-class exercises, you should:

- Submit an attempt for at least 80% of in-class exercises
- Pass at least 50% of in-class exercises
  
To pass an exercise, you should submit a first attempt by the initial deadline. You will have one week after that initial deadline to submit a passing attempt. If you don't submit it by the deadline, you should still attempt the exercise to get submission credit. 

Exercises will be automatically graded using GatorGrade. If you think GatorGrade has made a mistake, contact me. 

### Ideation & Independent Research

To receive a checkmark for this section, you should:

- Successfully complete the ideation objectives for at least two individual lab assignments, as well as your final project. These objectives might include generating an idea for a project using well-documented research, personal reflection, consideration of context, and brainstorming. You should show, in at least several projects, a clear reason for making what you are making.  
- Show ability to research code independently in two or more individual labs or projects. To receive independent research credit, be sure to document the part of your code that uses your research with "#INDEPENDENT RESEARCH" in your code comments. You should additionally include information on sources you cited and how you used them in your comments. More details will be provided in class.  
- Use markdown and code comments appropriately in your writing and documentation. 

### Reflection 

To receive a checkmark for this section, you should:

- Complete reflection objectives for at least 80% of lab and project assignments, and for your final project. Reflection objectives might include reflection on coding goals, conceptual goals, aesthetic goals and teamwork. 
- Successfully complete at least 80% of weekly discussion assignments. 

## Python Fundamentals 

There are ten Python fundamentals (or primitives) that will be evaluated. To receive a checkmark for a Python primitive, you must use it in a certain number of labs and timed assessments, as specified below. Primitives used in your final project will count toward lab credit. While you can use other peoples' code in your assignments, the code used toward these evaluations should be original. It should also be documented using code comments. 

Techniques used in group lab and project assignments can count toward your lab Python credits if you include a discussion that shows comprehension of these techniques in the lab reflection. 

| Category | Lab | Timed | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| variables | 3 | 3 |
| lists | 2 | 2 |
| while loops | 2 | 2 |
| for loops | 2 | 2 |
| math & logic | 2 | 2 |
| functions | 2 | 2 |
| return | 2 | 1 |
| dictionaries | 1 | 1 |
| classes | 1 | 1 |
| methods | 1 | 1 |

Note that tools such as Github, git and VSCode are not explicitly evaluated; however, this use is implicit in the successful completion of other outcomes and may be evaluated in certain exercises. 

As we go over these concepts, I will provide resources to give clarity on how you can incorporate them into your code. Everyone will receive ONE free point toward Python Fundamentals.

### Automated Grading

Note that most assignments in this course will be at least partly auto-graded using our in-house GatorGrade software. With in-class exercises, you can consider the GatorGrade results more or less accurate, with exceptions where the GatorGrade makes a mistake or where academic dishonesty is suspected. 

Labs, projects, discussions, and timed assessments may also be automatically graded, but in most cases the GatorGrade assessment should be considered preliminary. Especially in assignments that include written work, wait for the professor's evaluation before considering the grade solidified. 

## Course Policies

### Illness and Wellness, Mental and Physical 

<b>If you think you may be sick, stay home</b> —- particularly if your symptoms suggest a contagious illness (i.e. cough, fever, sneezing, sore throat). You will ultimately lose more time if you don't allow your body the rest it needs to heal. The class as a whole will succeed better if we make the effort to protect one another from illness. If you experience respiratory symptoms and do not feel you can miss class, please wear a mask that covers your nose and mouth. I will also entertain requests to record portions of class, but make no guarantees. 

As a college student, there may be times when personal stressors, struggles, and/or traumas interfere with your academic performance and/or negatively impact your daily life. Allegheny College recognizes that mental health is an important piece of the holistic human experience, and that this experience influences your academic success. We encourage students to prioritize their mental well-being by seeking services and support as needed. 

This class is designed with a relatively lenient attendance and deadline policy, in order to accommodate the obstacles that happen in real life (see evaluation section for more details). If you are sick, experiencing an emergency, or you are struggling emotionally, communicate with me about it as early as you can, and we will strategize accordingly. As long as you attend class and do coursework when you are feeling well, there is some space built in for harder times. If you feel overwhelmed even within these structures, you can let me know that too. 

If you are dealing with something contagious, or something that requires particular accommodations, feel free to let me know. Otherwise, I don't require details. You can simply let me know that you are struggling and I will believe you. Processing certain details may lie beyond my professional expertise, and I want to do my best to serve you in my capacity as your professor. 

Students who are in need of mental health support can access free, confidential services and resources in the Counseling and Personal Development Center (CPDC). CPDC delivers holistic mental health services to the Allegheny College student campus community through brief individual and group counseling, crisis support, outreach programming, consultation, and coordination of care. Students may request services by submitting a form on CPDC’s website (sites.allegheny.edu/counseling). Students may also connect with a mental health clinician at any time by calling Allegheny’s 24/7 line: 814-332-2105. If you or someone you know is experiencing a mental health emergency, please call the 24/7 line, Public Safety (814-332-3357), or 911. When in doubt, reach out. 

###  Assistance with course concepts 

Students who struggle to understand knowledge and skills defined in this course are encouraged to seek assistance from the course instructor and technical leaders. Students who need the course instructor’s or TL's assistance can schedule an appointment through their Office Hour Calendar near the top of this page. 


### Academic Alerts 

Allegheny College uses an Academic Alert system to send progress notices to the class deans in the Maytum Center for Student Success (MCSS). The progress notices are not punitive. They are an opportunity to connect you with your class dean who can offer additional support and suggest resources if you need assistance. These notices may encourage faculty advisors, coaches (for student-athletes), or other support staff to provide outreach to you as well. 

### Classroom ethics

The discipline of computer science, like many others, encourages its members to act according to discipline-specific ethics. I encourage you to take time to review the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) [Code of Ethics](https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/about/acm-code-of-ethics-booklet.pdf).

### Allegheny College Statement of Community

Allegheny College also expects students and faculty to act according to its Statement of Community:

> Allegheny students and employees are committed to creating an inclusive, respectful and safe residential learning community that will actively confront and challenge racism, sexism, heterosexism, religious bigotry, and other forms of harassment and discrimination. We encourage individual growth by promoting a free exchange of ideas in a setting that values diversity, trust and equality. So that the right of all to participate in a shared learning experience is upheld, Allegheny affirms its commitment to the principles of freedom of speech and inquiry, while at the same time fostering responsibility and accountability in the exercise of these freedoms. This statement does not replace existing personnel policies and codes of conduct.

Keep both of these standards in mind as you exercise your academic inquiry in this course. These serve as our fundamental "first principles" in pursuit of our shared academic goals.

### Honor Code

All students and faculty at Allegheny College are bound by the Honor Code. Everyone expects that your behavior reflects this commitment. Given the eminently shareable and reproducible nature of code, the Department of Computer Science adds the following statement to the general college policy:

> It is recognized that an important part of the learning process in any course, and particularly in computer science, derives from thoughtful discussions with teachers, student assistants, and fellow students.  Such dialogue is encouraged.  However, it is necessary to distinguish carefully between the student who discusses the principles underlying a problem with others, and the student who produces assignments that are identical to, or merely variations on, someone else’s work.  It will therefore be understood that all assignments submitted to faculty of the Department of Computer Science are to be the original work of the student submitting the assignment, and should be signed in accordance with the provisions of the Honor Code.  Appropriate action will be taken when assignments give evidence that they were derived from the work of others.

As the nature of "plagiarism" and constituents of "fair use" change often, the department encourages you to periodically review the specific tenets of the general college Honor Code provided in the latest course catalog and in the _Compass_.

The above statement, of course, also applies to online forums such as Stack Overflow, et al.

### Borrowed Code + Copilot in this class

As an elaboration of the honor code cited above, in this class we have specific policies about borrowed code, as well as AI-assisted code (Copilot). 

If you borrow any section of code more than two lines long (even if you modify it), you must link to the code source in the comments and specify where the borrowed code begins and ends. This includes code found online, code from your friends, and even code from class demos. In addition, note the lines you have modified in the code. In certain cases, you may be asked to document what each piece of code does, regardless of whether you borrowed it. 

If you use Copilot, you must identify the prompt in your code comments and also delineate the code that came from Copilot and if/how you modified it. 

Borrowing code correctly is a big part of being a professional computer scientist, and so it won’t be penalized as long as the code is cited as above and doesn’t constitute more than 50% of your project.

Work that violates the above policy will be dealt with as plagiarism. 

### Religious Observance

If you need to miss class or reschedule a final examination due to a religious observance, please speak to the professor well in advance 
to make arrangements. Please see https://sites.allegheny.edu/religiouslife/religious-holy-days/ for more details. 


### Educational Accommodations 

Students with disabilities who believe they 
may need accommodations in this class are encouraged to contact Student Accessibility and Support Services (SASS) at (814) 332-2898. Student Accessibility 
and Support Services is located in Pelletier Library. Please do this as soon as 
possible to ensure that such accommodations are implemented in a timely fashion. Please see https://sites.allegheny.edu/studentaccessibility/ for 
more details.
