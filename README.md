## Schedule of Topics

## Course Policies

### Illness and Wellness, Mental and Physical 

<b>If you think you may be sick, stay home</b> —- particularly if your symptoms suggest a contagious illness (i.e. cough, fever, sneezing, sore throat). You will ultimately lose more time if you don't allow your body the rest it needs to heal. The class as a whole will succeed better if we make the effort to protect one another from illness. If you experience respiratory symptoms and do not feel you can miss class, please wear a mask that covers your nose and mouth. I will also entertain request to record portions of class, but make no guarantees. 

As a college student, there may be times when personal stressors, struggles, and/or traumas interfere with your academic performance and/or negatively impact your daily life. Allegheny College recognizes that mental health is an important piece of the holistic human experience, and that this experience influences your academic success. We encourage students to prioritize their mental well-being by seeking services and support as needed. 

This class is designed with a relatively lenient attendance and deadline policy, in order to accomodate the obstacles that happen in real life (see evaluation section for more details). If you are sick, experiencing an emergency, or you are struggling emotionally, communicate with me about it as early as you can, and we will strategize accordingly. As long as you attend class and do coursework when you are feeling well, there is some space built in for harder times. If you feel overwhelmed even within these structures, you can let me know that too. 

If you are dealing with something contagious, or something that requires particular accomoodations, feel free to let me know. Otherwise, I don't require details. You can simply let me know that you are struggling and I will believe you. Processing certain details may lie beyond my professional expertise, and I want to do my best to serve you in my capacity as professor. 

Students who are in need of mental health support can access free, confidential services and resources in the Counseling and Personal Development Center (CPDC). CPDC delivers holistic mental health services to the Allegheny College student campus community through brief individual and group counseling, crisis support, outreach programming, consultation, and coordination of care. Students may request services by submitting a form on CPDC’s website (sites.allegheny.edu/counseling). Students may also connect with a mental health clinician at any time by calling Allegheny’s 24/7 line: 814-332-2105. If you or someone you know is experiencing a mental health emergency, please call the 24/7 line, Public Safety (814-332-3357), or 911. When in doubt, reach out. 

###  Assistance with course concepts 

Students who struggle to understand knowledge and skills defined in this course are encouraged to seek assistance from the course instructor and technical leaders. Students who need the course instructor’s or TL's assistance can schedule an appointment through their Office Hour Calendar near the top of this page. 


### Academic Alerts 

Allegheny College uses an Academic Alert system to send progress notices to the class deans in the Maytum Center for Student Success (MCSS). The progress notices are not punitive. They are an opportunity to connect you with your class dean who can offer additional support and suggest resources if you need assistance. These notices may encourage faculty advisors, coaches (for student-athletes), or other support staff to provide outreach to you as well. 

### Classroom ethics

The discipline of computer science, like many others, encourages its members to act according to discipline-specific ethics. I encourage you to take time to review the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) [Code of Ethics](https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/about/acm-code-of-ethics-booklet.pdf).

### Allegheny College Statement of Community

Allegheny College also expects students and faculty to act according to its Statement of Community:

> Allegheny students and employees are committed to creating an inclusive, respectful and safe residential learning community that will actively confront and challenge racism, sexism, heterosexism, religious bigotry, and other forms of harassment and discrimination. We encourage individual growth by promoting a free exchange of ideas in a setting that values diversity, trust and equality. So that the right of all to participate in a shared learning experience is upheld, Allegheny affirms its commitment to the principles of freedom of speech and inquiry, while at the same time fostering responsibility and accountability in the exercise of these freedoms. This statement does not replace existing personnel policies and codes of conduct.

Keep both of these standards in mind as you exercise your academic inquiry in this course. These serve as our fundamental "first principles" in pursuit of our shared academic goals.

### Honor Code

All students and faculty at Allegheny College are bound by the Honor Code. Everyone expects that your behavior reflects this commitment. Given the eminently shareable and reproducible nature of code, the Department of Computer Science adds the following statement to the general college policy:

> It is recognized that an important part of the learning process in any course, and particularly in computer science, derives from thoughtful discussions with teachers, student assistants, and fellow students.  Such dialogue is encouraged.  However, it is necessary to distinguish carefully between the student who discusses the principles underlying a problem with others, and the student who produces assignments that are identical to, or merely variations on, someone else’s work.  It will therefore be understood that all assignments submitted to faculty of the Department of Computer Science are to be the original work of the student submitting the assignment, and should be signed in accordance with the provisions of the Honor Code.  Appropriate action will be taken when assignments give evidence that they were derived from the work of others.

As the nature of "plagiarism" and constituents of "fair use" change often, the department encourages you to periodically review the specific tenets of the general college Honor Code provided in the latest course catalog and in the _Compass_.

The above statement, of course, also applies to online forums such as Stack Overflow, et al.

### Borrowed Code + Copilot in this class

As an elaboration of the honor code cited above, in this class we have specific policies about borrowed code, as well as AI-assisted code (Copilot). 

If you borrow any section of code more than two lines long (even if you modify it), you must link to the code source in the comments and specify where the borrowed code begins and ends. This includes code found online, code from your friends, and even code from class demos. In addition, note the lines you have modified in the code. In certain cases, you may be asked to document what each piece of code does, regardless of whether you borrowed it. 

If you use Copilot, you must identify the prompt in your code comments and also delineate the code that came from copilot and if/how you modified it. 

Borrowing code correctly is a big part of being a professional computer scientist, and so it won’t be penalized as long as the code is cited as above and doesn’t constitute more than 50% of your project.

Work that violates the above policy will be dealt with as plagiarism. 

### Religious Observance

If you need to miss class or reschedule a final examination due to a religious observance, please speak to the professor well in advance 
to make arrangements. Please see https://sites.allegheny.edu/religiouslife/religious-holy-days/ for more details. 


### Educational Accomodations 

Students with disabilities who believe they 
may need accommodations in this class are encouraged to contact Student Accessibility and Support Services (SASS) at (814) 332-2898. Student Accessibility 
and Support Services is located in Pelletier Library. Please do this as soon as 
possible to ensure that such accommodations are implemented in a timely fashion. Please see https://sites.allegheny.edu/studentaccessibility/ for 
more details.
