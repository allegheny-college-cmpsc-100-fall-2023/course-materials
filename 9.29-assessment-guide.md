# Study Guide for Timed Assessment on September 29

On Friday September 29, we will have our first timed assessment during our 10AM lecture period. 

### A great way to study for this assessment is to review your exercises and make sure you understand every line of code.

Click each exercise's title below to revisit it. You can study these exercises line by line. You can also submit or resubmit them if you haven't passed them yet: 

| Exercise |

| [two-boxes](https://classroom.github.com/a/IKa0spAE) |

Given the technical difficulties of the first month of school, and also because it's a great way to study, I am extending the submission period for all in-class exercises so far. You have until September 28 to submit all these exercises for partial credit (and for full credit in the case of more recent exercsies).

### Another great resource for study is the [lecture content](https://github.com/allegheny-college-cmpsc-100-fall-2023/course-materials/blob/main/lecture-content/lecture-links.md) from our classes so far.

### More on how the test works

The test will be in Github in the same format as most of our assignments, with the difference that you will not be able to update your code after the testing period is over, and you will not be able to see Gatorgrade checks. Github will pull your code wherever it is at the time of your last submission during the testing period. 

The test will be "open-book," meaning that you can look things up online while you are working on the test. HOWEVER, I have designed the test such that there are no solutions readily available on Google. While you may be able to look up the different concepts on the test, I will be asking you to apply them in a unique way. Because the assessment is timed, it's in your best interest to study ahead of time. 

The test will also be open enough that it is highly improbable that two students would write the same code, or even code that is very similar. 

<strong>In order to get credit for the code on the test, you must document it appropriately with code comments.</strong> Write a comment explaining what every line of code is doing. See code demos as well as [this chapter from <em>Think Python</em>](https://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/thinkpython2003.html#sec22) for examples of Code Comments.

You will have the opportunity to get checkmarks for variables, while loops, math and comparison operations (math and logic). You will have additional chances to get these checkmarks on future tests, so don't worry if you don't get through all of them this time! If you are super stressed out, you can even think of this test as practice. You will have more chances for every concept that's tested.
