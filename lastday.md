# It has been a pleasure working with all of you! I hope to see you in future terms. 

- Last day housekeeping: [fill out one more survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdilCfY8xe0xg87x09y7oXRWiCR3vJvlm8MWmF2WA5KS-2juw/viewform?usp=sf_link).
- If you want to share a lab and haven't already posted a link in Discord, do so now! 
- Note that I will accept ANY late work for partial credit until December 18. Your final project, however, is the best place to get remaining checks for Python fundamentals.
- After survey and lab shares, you can:
  - Work on your final project OR
  - Play Cassie McQuater's [Black Room](http://hgjfkdhskjdgturrgehdsbjkfhdsjkahturaytklfdjjfjfff.net/blackroom.html) and reply to the Discord thread for a little extra credit. I welcome playing in groups or on the lecturn computer.
