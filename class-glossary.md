# Class Glossary

**arguments** Arguments are the values that are sent to the function when it is called. [More here](https://www.w3schools.com/python/gloss_python_function_arguments.asp#:~:text=The%20terms%20parameter%20and%20argument,function%20when%20it%20is%20called.)

**branches** A branch represents an independent line of development in Git. When you create a branch, it copies over your code from the branch you've been working on (usually th
## Instructions e main or default branch). You then can switch into the new branch and make changes to it without worrying that it will affect the branch you've just copied. [Learn more here.](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches)

**command line interace (CLI)**  A user interface in which the user interacts with the computer through lines of text instead of graphical images.

**commit** Records changes to one or more files in your git repository. It's kind of like saving files, but can apply to multiple files in the repo at once. You can also always return to an old commit if you want to undo changes you've made since the commit. 

**dictionary** Data type that consists of a collection of key-value pairs. Each key-value pair maps the key to its associated value. [More here](https://realpython.com/python-dicts/#:~:text=Dictionaries%20are%20Python's%20implementation%20of,key%20to%20its%20associated%20value.)

**Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**  A software application that provides comprehensive facilities for software development. It may include a code editor, a CLI, a debugger etc. 

**functions** Functions are "self contained" modules of code that accomplish a specific task. Functions usually "take in" data, process it, and "return" a result. Once a function is written, it can be used over and over and over again. Functions can be "called" from the inside of other functions. [More here](https://users.cs.utah.edu/~germain/PPS/Topics/functions.html#:~:text=Functions%20are%20%22self%20contained%22%20modules,the%20inside%20of%20other%20functions.)

**Git** A version control system that allows you to keep track of your source code's history and switch among versions. 

**`git add`** Adds files listed after it to the next commit. Use `git add .` to add all files in the current directory to the next commit. 

**`git commit`** Creates a new commit with most recent changes in repo, contained in the files added with `git add`

**Github** A cloud-based hosting service that allows you to work with Git repositories both locally and remotely

**`git push`** pushes local changes to repository to remote. You need to commit changes before you can push them. 

**parameters** A parameter is the variable listed inside the parentheses in the function definition. [More here](https://www.w3schools.com/python/gloss_python_function_arguments.asp#:~:text=The%20terms%20parameter%20and%20argument,function%20when%20it%20is%20called.)

**pip** A package manager that allows you to install packages that extend Python. Some packages you might install with pip include gatorgrade and VPython. 

**pull requests (PRs)** A pull request is a request to merge changes from one branch of code into another. Usually pull requests will involve merging changes from a development branch into the main branch. This workflow allows us to take care in experimenting with code and making sure our changes can merge cleanly before we incoprorate our experiments into the main codebase. It also provies collaborative capacities where team members can work on the same file at the same time.


**repository** A central storage location for managing and tracking changes in files and directories. [More here.](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/git-tutorial/what-is-a-git-repository#:~:text=A%20Git%20repository%20is%20a,work%20on%20a%20project%20simultaneously.)

**Secure Socket Shell (SSH)** A cryptographic system that allows you to secure digital assets with strong ciphers. In Github, SSH allows you to access your work on Github from the command line safely. 

**Terminal** A commonly-used CLI

**VSCode** A comprehensive IDE
